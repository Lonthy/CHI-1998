Here you will see the documentation and analisis for our proyect. 
Now we are basing our process in the *Human-centered design*  methodology

HCD consists in three stages:

1. Listen
2. Create
3. Deliver
~~~

#### Listen phase

~~~
The design of significant and innovative solutions that works for the 
community members begins with the understanding of the needs, hopes and 
aspirations that they have for the future.
~~~

### Create phase

~~~
In this phase you transform what you have investigated in a set of 
strategic orientations and agile solutions, sing both the left 
hemisphere (logical thinking) and the right hemisphere 
(creative thinking).
~~~

### Deliver phase

~~~
This phase is a challenge for the team to create the necessary 
elements for the solution to succeed and to see what the impact 
of the solution will be.
